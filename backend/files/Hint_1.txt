What is Middleware? It is those methods/functions/operations that are called BETWEEN processing the Request and sending the Response in your application method.

When talking about express.json() and express.urlencoded() think specifically about POST requests (i.e. the .post request object) and PUT Requests (i.e. the .put request object)

You DO NOT NEED express.json() and express.urlencoded() for GET Requests or DELETE Requests.

You NEED express.json() and express.urlencoded() for POST and PUT requests, because in both these requests you are sending data (in the form of some data object) to the server and you are asking the server to accept or store that data (object), which is enclosed in the body (i.e. req.body) of that (POST or PUT) Request

Express provides you with middleware to deal with the (incoming) data (object) in the body of the request.

a. express.json() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: app.use(express.json());

b. express.urlencoded() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as strings or arrays. This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: app.use(express.urlencoded());

ALTERNATIVELY, I recommend using body-parser (it is an NPM package) to do the same thing. It is developed by the same peeps who built express and is designed to work with express. body-parser used to be part of express. Think of body-parser specifically for POST Requests (i.e. the .post request object) and/or PUT Requests (i.e. the .put request object).

In body-parser you can do

const path = require('path')
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
// calling body-parser to handle the Request Object from POST requests
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
// parse application/json, basically parse incoming Request Object as a JSON Object 
app.use(bodyParser.json());
// parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded, basically can only parse incoming Request Object if strings or arrays
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
// combines the 2 above, then you can parse incoming Request Object if object, with nested objects, or generally any type.
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

const path = require('path')
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
//However, the path that you provide to the express.static function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, itâ€™s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve:

const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
	console.log('Method:', request.method)
	console.log('Path:  ', request.path)
	console.log('Body:  ', request.body)
	console.log('---')
	next()
}
app.use(requestLogger)
// Notice that json-parser is taken into use before the requestLogger middleware, because otherwise request.body will not be initialized when the logger is executed!

const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' })
}
app.use(unknownEndpoint)
//That is used for catching requests made to non-existent routes. For these requests, the middleware will return an error message in the JSON format.
